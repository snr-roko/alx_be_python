# Declaring variable to assign the number of hours to
hours = 2

# Calculating hours to seconds
# Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and another 60 seconds in a minute
# An hour to minute equals 60 * 60 which is 3600

seconds = hours * 3600

# Printing the calculated seconds 

print(str(hours) + " hour(s) is " + str(seconds) + " seconds.")
